# Monotonic Progress

## Design Goals

- For every workflow that records progress for later use across retries, resumptions, or actors, converge on its
  terminal acceptance state through one authoritative, evidence-backed transition record. Each accepted transition
  preserves or advances verified state, or explicitly invalidates only the affected state with its reason and
  replacement path; stale, duplicate, or conflicting work cannot replace verified progress.
- Complete independent work units with the highest verified bounded concurrency that preserves their isolated state,
  evidence, and failure visibility rather than serializing them without a dependency.

## Guidance

Before a workflow records progress for later use, define one authoritative durable transition record, its owner, storage
location, consumers, terminal acceptance state, independently nameable work units, and permitted transitions. An actor
must claim a work unit through that record or receive an equivalent serialized assignment before advancing it. Define
the evidence and transition that invalidates or reassigns a claim when its responsible actor cannot complete it.
At minimum, model each unit as unclaimed, claimed, verified, invalidated, or reassigned; the workflow is terminal only
when its acceptance record verifies every required unit.

Record each proposed transition with its current predecessor state or version, responsible actor, work unit, evidence,
and resulting state. Accept it only when the predecessor remains current and the evidence verifies its result. An
accepted transition must preserve verified work and advance the remaining path to the terminal acceptance state, or
explicitly invalidate only the affected state with its reason and replacement path. Reject or explicitly reconcile
stale, duplicate, or conflicting results without overwriting unaffected verified state.

Use a queue, single orchestrator, lease, append-only ledger, compare-and-set record, or another mechanism that provides
these observable guarantees; do not require a particular mechanism when the workflow does not need it. Before an actor
treats work as assigned or complete, it must retrieve the durable record and verify the stated evidence. On retry or
resumption, reuse every verified completed unit and continue only with the next unverified, unclaimed, or explicitly
invalidated or reassigned unit.

When a workflow evaluates, compares, certifies, or otherwise reuses a result, record the complete evaluation identity
before work that can change its inputs begins. The identity includes every candidate, delivered guidance bundle, input
population, reserved input, runtime artifact, execution plan, and policy whose change would make a later result answer
a different question. A retry must reuse those exact recorded inputs and completed units. Reject an attempted retry that
silently changes one; create a distinct identity only through a terminal, explicit superseding transition that retains
the earlier record and states why its result cannot be compared with the replacement.

When independently executable units can run concurrently, choose the highest bounded concurrency supported by the
available capacity and the workflow's isolation guarantees. A persistent parent must own and reap every child, record
each terminal result, and return failure when any required child fails; a parent that exits while children run cannot
establish their result. Give concurrent units separate mutable resources and durable evidence. Do not treat partial
output, a started process, or a child that has not reached a terminal recorded state as successful work.
