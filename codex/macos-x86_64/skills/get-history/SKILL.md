description: Use when running on Codex and you need to examine past conversation, session logs, or raw chat history.
---

Resolve the installed `get-history` at `${CAT_PLUGIN_ROOT}/client/bin/get-history`. Pass the
thread ID whose rollout you need as its first argument; the launcher uses Codex's native home only to locate that one
rollout JSONL. This can be the current thread ID or another known thread ID. If the launcher does not exist, report that
exact path before applying the shared source-checkout fallback. Do not derive or select a transcript path in Bash.

For example:

```bash
/absolute/path/get-history "$CODEX_THREAD_ID" analyze
/absolute/path/get-history "$CODEX_THREAD_ID" summary --since "2026-08-18T10:00:00Z" --type "message" --limit 50
/absolute/path/get-history "$CODEX_THREAD_ID" search "keyword" --context 2
/absolute/path/get-history "$CODEX_THREAD_ID" errors
/absolute/path/get-history "$CODEX_THREAD_ID" file-history "config.json"
```

# Shared First Use

## Design Goals

- Ensure an agent reads and follows a selected skill's complete instructions once in each conversation context.

## Guidance

If you have not already read this skill's `first-use.md` in the current
conversation context, read it now and follow it exactly. Otherwise, reuse its guidance.
Read `first-use.md` again after the context resets or is compacted.
