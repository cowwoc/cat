# Validation-Driven Document Compression

**Issue**: Compress the documentation file: `{{arg}}`

**Goal**: Reduce document size while preserving execution equivalence using
objective validation instead of prescriptive rules.

---

## CRITICAL: Always Use This Skill (M294, M296)

**NEVER manually compress files and validate with /compare-docs directly.**

Manual compression bypasses:
1. The **iteration loop** that automatically retries when status = NOT_EQUIVALENT
2. The **EQUIVALENT requirement** enforced for shrink-doc
3. The **structured feedback** (LOST units list) that guides compression improvements

If you compress manually and get NOT_EQUIVALENT, you must manually iterate.
If you use this skill, iteration happens automatically until status = EQUIVALENT.

**MANDATORY: Report validation status (M296)**

When compressing files (even partially), you MUST report:
- Validation status per file (EQUIVALENT or NOT_EQUIVALENT from /compare-docs)
- Token counts per file (before and after)

If you compressed files without reporting these metrics, you violated this requirement.
Go back and run /compare-docs validation for each file, then report results.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Document Type

**BEFORE compression**, verify this is a Claude-facing document:

**ALLOWED** (Claude-facing):
- `.claude/` configuration files:
  - `.claude/agents/` - Agent definitions (prompts for sub-agents)
  - `.claude/commands/` - **Slash commands** (prompts that expand when invoked)
  - `.claude/hooks/` - Hook scripts (execute on events)
  - `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings
- `CLAUDE.md` and project instructions
- `docs/project/` development protocol documentation
- `docs/code-style/*-claude.md` style detection patterns

**Why slash commands are Claude-facing**: When you invoke `/shrink-doc`, the
contents of `.claude/commands/shrink-doc.md` expand into a prompt for Claude
to execute. The file is NOT for users to read - it's a configuration that
defines what Claude does when the command is invoked.

**FORBIDDEN** (Human-facing):
- `README.md`, `changelog.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/studies/`, `docs/decisions/`, `docs/performance/`
- `docs/optional-modules/` (potentially user-facing)
- `todo.md`, `docs/code-style/*-human.md`

**⚠️ SPECIAL HANDLING: CLAUDE.md**

When compressing `CLAUDE.md`, the compression agent uses **content reorganization** instead of
standard compression. The detailed reorganization algorithm is in COMPRESSION-AGENT.md.

**Validation after compression:**
```bash
# CLAUDE.md should be ~200-250 lines (not 800+)
wc -l CLAUDE.md

# No procedural duplication with skills
grep -c "Step 1:" CLAUDE.md  # Should be minimal
```

---

**⚠️ SPECIAL HANDLING: Style Documentation Files**

When compressing `.claude/rules/*.md` or `docs/code-style/*-claude.md`, the compression agent
follows special rules defined in COMPRESSION-AGENT.md. The orchestrator does NOT need to know
what to preserve/remove - just invoke the subagent and validate the result.

**Verification Required (orchestrator runs AFTER compression)**: Count section headers:
```bash
ORIGINAL_SECTIONS=$(grep -c "^### " /tmp/original-{filename})
COMPRESSED_SECTIONS=$(grep -c "^### " /tmp/compressed-{filename}-v${VERSION}.md)
if [ "$COMPRESSED_SECTIONS" -lt "$ORIGINAL_SECTIONS" ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Section(s) removed! Original: $ORIGINAL_SECTIONS, Compressed: $COMPRESSED_SECTIONS"
  echo "   Style rule sections must be preserved. Iterate to restore missing sections."
fi
```

**Why This Protection Exists**: Session from 2025-12-19 had documentation update remove
intentionally-added "Use 'empty' Not 'blank'" style rule section, causing repeated data loss
during subsequent rebases.

**If forbidden**, respond:
```
This compression process only applies to Claude-facing documentation.
The file `{{arg}}` appears to be human-facing documentation.
```

**Examples**:
- ✅ ALLOWED: `.claude/commands/shrink-doc.md` (slash command prompt)
- ✅ ALLOWED: `.claude/agents/architect.md` (agent prompt)
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: `README.md` (user-facing project description)
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: `changelog.md` (user-facing change history)

---

### Step 2: Check for Existing Baseline

**Check if baseline exists from prior iteration**:

```bash
BASELINE="/tmp/original-{{filename}}"
if [ -f "$BASELINE" ]; then
  BASELINE_LINES=$(wc -l < "$BASELINE")
  CURRENT_LINES=$(wc -l < "{{arg}}")
  echo "✅ Found existing baseline: $BASELINE ($BASELINE_LINES lines)"
  echo "   Current file: $CURRENT_LINES lines"
  echo "   Scores will compare against original baseline."
fi
```

**If NO baseline exists**, optionally check git history for prior compression:

```bash
if [ ! -f "$BASELINE" ]; then
  RECENT_SHRINK=$(git log --oneline -5 -- {{arg}} 2>/dev/null | grep -iE "compress|shrink|reduction" | head -1)
  if [ -n "$RECENT_SHRINK" ]; then
    echo "ℹ️ Note: File was previously compressed (commit: $RECENT_SHRINK)"
    echo "   No baseline preserved. Starting fresh with current version as baseline."
  fi
fi
```

---

### Step 3: Invoke Compression Agent

**⚠️ ENCAPSULATION (M269)**: The compression algorithm is in a separate internal document.
Do NOT attempt to compress manually - invoke the subagent which will read its own instructions.

**Subagent invocation** (use Task tool, not TaskCreate - see M372 in subagent-delegation.md):

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Compress {{arg}}"
  prompt: |
    Read the instructions at: plugin/skills/shrink-doc/COMPRESSION-AGENT.md

    Then compress the following file according to those instructions:
    - FILE_PATH: {{arg}}
    - OUTPUT_PATH: /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v${VERSION}.md

    Use the Write tool to save the compressed version.
```

**Why separate documents (M269)**: The compression algorithm is intentionally NOT in this file.
If you can see HOW to compress, you might bypass the skill and do it manually - which skips
validation. The subagent reads COMPRESSION-AGENT.md; you (the orchestrator) only invoke and validate.

---

### Step 4: Validate with /compare-docs

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Before saving compressed version, read and save the ORIGINAL
document state to use as baseline for validation.

After agent completes:

1. **Save original document** (ONLY if baseline doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   BASELINE="/tmp/original-{{filename}}"
   if [ ! -f "$BASELINE" ]; then
     cp {{arg}} "$BASELINE"
     echo "✅ Saved baseline: $BASELINE ($(wc -l < "$BASELINE") lines)"
   else
     echo "✅ Reusing existing baseline: $BASELINE"
   fi
   ```

   **Why baseline is preserved**: Baseline is kept until user explicitly confirms
   they're done iterating (see Step 5). This ensures scores always compare against
   the TRUE original, not intermediate compressed versions.

2. **Determine version number and save compressed version**:
   ```bash
   VERSION_FILE="/tmp/shrink-doc-{{filename}}-version.txt"

   # Get next version number from persistent counter (survives across sessions)
   if [ -f "$VERSION_FILE" ]; then
     LAST_VERSION=$(cat "$VERSION_FILE")
     VERSION=$((LAST_VERSION + 1))
   else
     # First time: check for existing version files to continue numbering
     HIGHEST=$(ls /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v*.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*-v\([0-9]*\)\.md/\1/' | sort -n | tail -1)
     if [ -n "$HIGHEST" ]; then
       VERSION=$((HIGHEST + 1))
     else
       VERSION=1
     fi
   fi

   # Save version counter for next iteration
   echo "$VERSION" > "$VERSION_FILE"

   # Save with version number for rollback capability
   # Agent output → /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v${VERSION}.md
   echo "📝 Saved as version ${VERSION}: /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v${VERSION}.md"
   ```

   **Why persistent versioning**: Version numbers continue across sessions (v1, v2 in session 1 →
   v3, v4 in session 2) so older revisions are never overwritten. This enables rollback to any
   previous version and maintains complete compression history.

3. **Verify YAML frontmatter preserved** (if compressing slash command):
   ```bash
   head -5 /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v${VERSION}.md | grep -q "^---$" || echo "⚠️ WARNING: YAML frontmatter missing!"
   ```

4. **Run validation via /cat:delegate (M371)**:

   Use `/cat:delegate` for ALL validation (single or multiple files). The compare-docs skill
   handles extraction, comparison, and report generation.

   ```bash
   /cat:delegate --skill compare-docs /tmp/original-{{filename}} /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v${VERSION}.md
   ```

   **Why delegate (M371)**: Delegate handles:
   - Subagent spawning with appropriate model selection (opus for validation)
   - Isolation of validation context from main agent
   - Result collection and formatting

   **The compare-docs skill handles internally**:
   - Parallel extraction from both documents (3-agent model)
   - Binary equivalence determination (EQUIVALENT or NOT_EQUIVALENT)

   **Parse validation result from delegate output**:
   - Extract `Status:` line (EQUIVALENT or NOT_EQUIVALENT with counts)
   - Extract LOST section for iteration feedback
   - Extract ADDED section (informational only)

   **If Status = NOT_EQUIVALENT**: Proceed to Step 6 (Iteration). After creating new version,
   re-run validation on the NEW compressed version.

5. **Parse validation result**:
   - Find the `Status:` line in the COMPARISON RESULT
   - Extract the LOST section (needed for iteration feedback)

**Validation Context**: When reporting to the user, explicitly state:
```
Status: {EQUIVALENT|NOT_EQUIVALENT} compares the compressed version against
the ORIGINAL document state from before /shrink-doc was invoked.
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER**: On second, third, etc. invocations:
- ✅ **REUSE** `/tmp/original-{{filename}}` from first invocation
- ✅ Always compare against original baseline (not intermediate versions)
- The baseline is set ONCE on first invocation and REUSED for all subsequent invocations

---

### Step 5: Decision Logic

**Threshold**: EQUIVALENT status required (no "close enough" - see M254)

**COMMIT GATE (M335)**: Files may ONLY be committed after validation passes:
- Status = NOT_EQUIVALENT → File MUST NOT be applied or committed
- Status = EQUIVALENT → File may be applied and committed
- Skipped validation → File MUST NOT be applied or committed

Rationalizations like "extraction variance" or "validation is broken" are completion bias.
If validation consistently fails, the compression is too aggressive - iterate or abandon.

**Report Format** (for approval):
1. Validation output from /compare-docs (copy verbatim)
2. **Version Comparison Table** (showing all versions generated in this session)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Report the ACTUAL score from /compare-docs. Do not summarize or interpret.

**Version Comparison Table Format**:

After presenting validation results for ANY version, show comparison table.

**Token Counting**: Use tiktoken for accurate token counts:

```bash
# Actual token count using tiktoken
TOKENS=$(python3 -c "
import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('cl100k_base')
with open('$FILE', 'r') as f:
    print(len(enc.encode(f.read())))
")
```

**Table format:**

| Version      | Tokens | Reduction | Preserved | Status     |
|--------------|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Original** | {n}    | baseline  | N/A       | Reference  |
| **V{n}**     | {n}    | {n}%      | {X}/{Y}   | {status}   |

**Status values**:
- EQUIVALENT = All units preserved, approved for commit
- NOT_EQUIVALENT = Units lost, requires iteration
- Applied = Currently applied to original file

---

**If status = EQUIVALENT**: ✅ **APPROVE**
```
Validation passed! Status: EQUIVALENT ({X}/{Y} preserved)

✅ Approved version: /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v${VERSION}.md

Writing compressed version to {{arg}}...
```
→ Overwrite original with approved version
→ Clean up versioned compressions: `rm /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v*.md`
→ **KEEP baseline**: `/tmp/original-{{filename}}` preserved for potential future iterations

**After applying changes, ASK user**:
```
Changes applied successfully!

Would you like to try again to generate an even better version?
- YES → I'll keep the baseline and iterate with new compression targets
- NO → I'll clean up the baseline (compression complete)
```

**If user says YES** (wants to try again):
→ Keep `/tmp/original-{{filename}}`
→ Future /shrink-doc invocations will reuse this baseline
→ Scores will reflect cumulative compression from true original
→ Go back to Step 3 with user's feedback

**If user says NO** (done iterating):
→ `rm /tmp/original-{{filename}}`
→ `rm /tmp/shrink-doc-{{filename}}-version.txt`
→ Note: Future /shrink-doc on this file will use compressed version as new baseline

**If status = NOT_EQUIVALENT**: ❌ **ITERATE**
```
Validation requires improvement. Status: NOT_EQUIVALENT ({X}/{Y} preserved, {Z} lost)

{Copy /compare-docs LOST section verbatim - shows what units need to be restored}

Re-invoking agent with feedback to fix issues...
```
→ Go to Step 6 (Iteration)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Validation Gate (M254)**

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**: Complete this validation BEFORE making any approval decision.

**Parse the COMPARISON RESULT from /compare-docs:**

The report contains this key line (exact format):
```
Status: EQUIVALENT | NOT_EQUIVALENT (X/Y preserved, Z lost)
```

**Extract the status:**
- Find the line starting with `Status:`
- Check if it says `EQUIVALENT` or `NOT_EQUIVALENT`

**Decision logic:**
```
if Status contains "EQUIVALENT" and NOT "NOT_EQUIVALENT":
  DECISION = "APPROVE"
else:
  DECISION = "ITERATE"
```

**FAIL-FAST**: If DECISION=ITERATE:
1. **STOP** - do not ask user for approval
2. **Extract** the LOST section from the report (lists units that need restoration)
3. **Proceed** directly to Step 6 (Iteration Loop) with that feedback

**Why this gate exists (M254)**: Completion bias causes agents to rationalize "close enough". Only EQUIVALENT status permits approval. No exceptions.

---

### Step 6: Iteration Loop

**If status = NOT_EQUIVALENT**, invoke agent again with specific feedback:

**Iteration Prompt Template**:
```
**Document Compression - Revision Attempt {iteration_number}**

**Previous Status**: NOT_EQUIVALENT ({X}/{Y} preserved, {Z} lost)

**Lost Semantic Units** (MUST be restored):

{for each lost unit from LOST section:}
- [{CATEGORY}] "{original text of lost unit}"

**Your Task**:

Revise the compressed document to restore the lost semantic units while maintaining compression.

**Original**: /tmp/original-{{filename}}
**Previous Attempt**: /tmp/compressed-{{filename}}-v${VERSION}.md

Focus on:
1. Restoring the exact semantic meaning of each lost unit
2. Maintaining conditional structure (IF-THEN-ELSE)
3. Preserving mutual exclusivity constraints (EXCLUSION category)
4. Keeping temporal ordering (SEQUENCE category)
5. Keeping prohibition constraints (PROHIBITION category)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: USE THE WRITE TOOL to save the revised document to the specified path.
Do NOT just describe or return the content - you MUST physically write the file.
```

**After iteration**:
- Save revised version as next version number (v${VERSION+1})
- Re-run /compare-docs validation **AGAINST ORIGINAL BASELINE**
- Apply decision logic again (Step 5)

**🚨 MANDATORY: /compare-docs Required for EVERY Iteration**

**CRITICAL**: You MUST invoke `/compare-docs` for EVERY version validation.
No exceptions. Status is ONLY valid if it comes from /compare-docs output.

```bash
/compare-docs /tmp/original-{filename} /tmp/compressed-{filename}-v{N}.md
```

**Self-Check Before Reporting Status**:
1. Did I invoke /compare-docs for this version? YES/NO
2. Is the status from /compare-docs output? YES/NO
3. If either is NO → STOP and invoke /compare-docs

**Maximum iterations**: 3
- If still NOT_EQUIVALENT after 3 attempts, report to user and ask for guidance
- All versions preserved in /tmp for rollback
- User may choose to accept best attempt or abandon compression

---

## Multiple Files: Use /cat:delegate (M369)

**For compressing multiple files**, use `/cat:delegate`:

```bash
/cat:delegate --skill shrink-doc file1.md file2.md file3.md
```

Delegate handles:
- Parallel subagent spawning (one per file, each running this full workflow)
- Fault-tolerant result collection
- Automatic retry of failed subagents
- Result aggregation into per-file table

**Do NOT manually spawn Task tools for batch operations** - delegate already implements
parallel execution, fault tolerance, and retry logic.

**Per-file validation (M265, M346):** Each file MUST be validated individually. Report results:

| File | Tokens Before | Tokens After | Reduction | Preserved | Status |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| {filename} | {count} | {count} | {%} | {X}/{Y} | {EQUIVALENT/NOT_EQUIVALENT} |

**Validation separation (M277):** Compression subagents must NOT validate their own work.
Each shrink-doc subagent spawns SEPARATE validation subagents per Step 4.

---

## Implementation Notes

**Agent Type**: MUST use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`

**Validation Tool**: Use `/cat:delegate --skill compare-docs` (M371) - delegate handles subagent
spawning and result collection.

**Validation Baseline**: On first invocation, save original document to
`/tmp/original-{filename}` and use this as baseline for ALL subsequent
validation comparisons in the session.

**Versioning Scheme**: Each compression attempt is saved with incrementing
version numbers for rollback capability.

**File Operations**:
- Read original: `Read` tool
- Save original baseline: `Write` tool to `/tmp/original-{filename}` (once per session)
- Save versioned compressed: `Write` tool to `/tmp/compressed-{filename}-v1.md`,
  `/tmp/compressed-{filename}-v2.md`, etc.
- Overwrite original: `Write` tool to `{{arg}}` (only after approval)
- Cleanup after approval: `rm /tmp/compressed-{filename}-v*.md /tmp/original-{filename}`

**Rollback Capability**:
- If latest version unsatisfactory, previous versions available at `/tmp/compressed-{filename}-v{N}.md`
- Example: If v3 approved but later found problematic, can review v1 or v2
- Versions automatically cleaned up after successful approval

**Iteration State**:
- Track iteration count via version numbers
- Provide specific feedback from validation warnings
- ALWAYS validate against original baseline, not previous iteration

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Compression approved** when:
- /compare-docs returns Status: EQUIVALENT

✅ **Compression quality** metrics:
- Word reduction: ~50% (target, secondary to equivalence)
- All semantic units preserved (X/X in status)
- No units in LOST section

---

## Edge Cases

**Abstraction vs Enumeration**: When compressed document uses high-level
constraint statements (e.g., "handlers are mutually exclusive") instead of
explicit pairwise enumerations, validation may return NOT_EQUIVALENT with
specific EXCLUSION units in the LOST section. System will automatically
iterate to restore explicit constraints.

**Persistent NOT_EQUIVALENT**: If multiple iterations needed but LOST count
doesn't decrease (e.g., v1=3 lost, v2=3 lost, v3=2 lost), compression
may be hitting fundamental limits. After 3 attempts with units still lost,
report best version to user and explain compression challenges encountered.

**Multiple Iterations**: Each iteration should reduce the LOST count. Monitor
progression toward EQUIVALENT status (0 lost).

**Large Documents**: For documents >10KB, consider breaking into logical sections
and compressing separately to improve iteration efficiency.

**Sequence Decomposition (Extraction Variance)**: When LOST section shows SEQUENCE units
that appear to have the same content as units in the compressed version, the issue is
likely extraction variance - one agent extracted a numbered list as a single chain
(e.g., `sequence: A → B → C`) while the other decomposed it into separate transitions.

Symptoms:
- High unit count difference between extractions (e.g., 17 vs 15 units)
- Multiple SEQUENCE units in LOST section
- Similar content exists in compressed version but as separate statements

Solution: Preserve numbered lists with their original formatting. The compression agent
should NOT convert `1. X 2. Y 3. Z` into prose like "X, then Y, then Z".

**Checklist Extraction**: Verification checklists (`- [ ] item`) may not extract
consistently. Preserve checklist formatting exactly - don't convert to prose bullets.

**Structural Marker Removal**: When validation fails after seemingly minor changes
(reformatting, word removal), check if structural markers were removed:

Symptoms:
- Low equivalence score despite minimal content changes
- CONDITIONAL or CONSEQUENCE units in LOST section
- Changes involved removing words like "then", "In this case:", "Otherwise"

Root cause: Structural markers ("then", "In this case:", "When...") signal how extraction
agents categorize content. Removing them changes categorization, causing NOT_EQUIVALENT
even when semantic content appears preserved.

Solution: Iterate with explicit instruction to restore structural markers. The compression
agent documentation includes specific guidance on preserving conditional/consequence structure.

**Line Wrapping Changes**: If compression only changed line breaks without removing
actual content, this is NOT valid compression. Line reformatting can cause extraction
variance without providing any semantic benefit. Iterate with instruction to preserve
original line structure and focus on removing actual redundant content instead.

## Example Usage

```
/shrink-doc /workspace/main/.claude/commands/example-command.md
```

Expected flow:
1. Validate document type ✅
2. Save original to /tmp/original-example-command.md (baseline) ✅
3. Invoke compression agent
4. Save to /tmp/compressed-example-command-v1.md (version 1) ✅
5. Run /compare-docs /tmp/original-example-command.md /tmp/compressed-example-command-v1.md
6. Status = EQUIVALENT → Approve v1 and overwrite original ✅
7. Cleanup: Remove /tmp/compressed-example-command-v*.md and /tmp/original-example-command.md ✅

**If iteration needed**:
- v1 NOT_EQUIVALENT (3 lost) → Save v2, validate against original
- v2 NOT_EQUIVALENT (1 lost) → Save v3, validate against original
- v3 EQUIVALENT → Approve v3, cleanup v1/v2/v3 and original
- v3 NOT_EQUIVALENT (after max iterations) → Report to user with best version
