# Plan: refactor-plugin-bundled-rules

## Current State

`InjectSessionInstructions.java` contains a ~312-line hardcoded Java string with all session behavioral rules
(user input handling, mistake tracking, commit workflow, skill compliance, worktree isolation, etc.). This string
is compiled into the jlink binary and injected on every SessionStart. Rules cannot be edited without recompilation,
cannot target subagents independently, and cannot use the same audience-filtering infrastructure as
`.claude/cat/rules/`.

## Target State

- New directory `plugin/rules/` ships with the plugin and is installed to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/`
- Rule files in `plugin/rules/` use the same YAML frontmatter format as `.claude/cat/rules/` (audience filtering
  via `mainAgent:`, `subagent:`, `paths:` fields)
- `InjectRulesToMainAgent` and `InjectRulesToSubAgent` read from TWO sources:
  1. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/` — plugin-bundled rules (end-user facing)
  2. `${projectDir}/.claude/cat/rules/` — project-local rules (developer facing)
- Plugin-bundled rules are invisible in the end-user's `.claude/cat/rules/` directory — they are read directly
  from the plugin cache
- `InjectSessionInstructions` hardcoded string is split into individual `.md` files in `plugin/rules/`, each with
  appropriate audience tags
- `InjectSessionInstructions` class is removed entirely
- `EchoSessionId` (a separate handler already registered in `SessionStartHook`) already injects `Session ID: {id}`
  independently — no special handling needed when removing `InjectSessionInstructions`

## Satisfies

None — architectural refactor

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Breaking Changes:** Rule content moves from compiled Java to runtime-read files; any parsing error would
  cause rules to not be injected
- **Mitigation:** Validate all rule files parse correctly in tests; keep InjectSessionInstructions as fallback
  until migration is verified end-to-end

## Files to Modify

- `plugin/rules/` — new directory with individual rule `.md` files (split from InjectSessionInstructions)
- `client/src/main/java/io/github/cowwoc/cat/hooks/session/InjectRulesToMainAgent.java` — add plugin rules
  source path
- `client/src/main/java/io/github/cowwoc/cat/hooks/session/InjectRulesToSubAgent.java` — add plugin rules
  source path
- `client/src/main/java/io/github/cowwoc/cat/hooks/util/RulesDiscovery.java` — extend to accept multiple
  source directories
- `client/src/main/java/io/github/cowwoc/cat/hooks/session/InjectSessionInstructions.java` — remove or reduce
- `client/src/main/java/io/github/cowwoc/cat/hooks/SessionStartHook.java` — remove InjectSessionInstructions
  from handler list (if fully replaced)

## Pre-conditions

- [ ] refactor-rules-injection-classes is closed (InjectRulesToMainAgent and InjectRulesToSubAgent exist)

## Execution Waves

### Wave 1: Create plugin rules directory and split InjectSessionInstructions

- Create `plugin/rules/` directory
- Split `InjectSessionInstructions.INSTRUCTIONS` string into individual `.md` files, each with YAML frontmatter:
  - `plugin/rules/user-input-handling.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/mistake-handling.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/commit-before-review.md` — mainAgent: true, subagent: true
  - `plugin/rules/skill-workflow-compliance.md` — mainAgent: true, subagent: true
  - `plugin/rules/persisted-skill-output.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/work-request-handling.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/implementation-delegation.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/worktree-isolation.md` — mainAgent: true, subagent: true
  - `plugin/rules/fail-fast-protocol.md` — mainAgent: true, subagent: true
  - `plugin/rules/verbatim-output-skills.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/qualified-issue-names.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/issue-lock-checking.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/tool-usage-efficiency.md` — mainAgent: true, subagent: true
  - `plugin/rules/background-task-retrieval.md` — mainAgent: true
  - `plugin/rules/git-identity-protection.md` — mainAgent: true, subagent: true
  - Files: `plugin/rules/*.md`
  - Each file gets a license header (per license-header.md rules for `.md` files)

### Wave 2: Extend RulesDiscovery and injection classes

- Extend `RulesDiscovery.getCatRulesForAudience()` to accept a list of source directories instead of one:
  - Files: `RulesDiscovery.java`
  - New signature: `getCatRulesForAudience(List<Path> rulesDirs, ...)` or overload that merges results
  - Discover rules from all directories, concatenate (plugin rules first, project-local second), then
    filter by audience
  - No filename-based deduplication — if the same filename exists in both sources, both are included

- Update `InjectRulesToMainAgent` to read from both sources:
  - Files: `InjectRulesToMainAgent.java`
  - Source 1: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/` (requires `JvmScope` to provide plugin root path)
  - Source 2: `${projectDir}/.claude/cat/rules/`

- Update `InjectRulesToSubAgent` to read from both sources:
  - Files: `InjectRulesToSubAgent.java`
  - Same two sources as above

- Remove `InjectSessionInstructions.java` entirely (session ID already handled by `EchoSessionId`)
- Update `SessionStartHook.java` to remove `InjectSessionInstructions` from handler list

- Add/update tests:
  - Files: test classes for `InjectRulesToMainAgent`, `InjectRulesToSubAgent`, `RulesDiscovery`
  - Test: plugin rules directory is read and content injected
  - Test: plugin rules and project rules are concatenated in order (plugin first, project second)
  - Test: audience filtering works across both sources
  - Test: missing plugin rules directory is handled gracefully
  - Test: session ID is still injected (by existing EchoSessionId, not by plugin rules)

- Run `mvn -f client/pom.xml verify`
- Update STATE.md: status closed, progress 100%
- Commit: `refactor: replace InjectSessionInstructions with plugin-bundled rule files`

## Post-conditions

- [ ] `plugin/rules/` directory exists with individual rule `.md` files
- [ ] All content from `InjectSessionInstructions.INSTRUCTIONS` is present in `plugin/rules/*.md` files
- [ ] `InjectRulesToMainAgent` reads from both `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/` and `${projectDir}/.claude/cat/rules/`
- [ ] `InjectRulesToSubAgent` reads from both sources
- [ ] Plugin-bundled rules are NOT visible in end-user's `.claude/cat/rules/` directory
- [ ] Rules with `subagent: true` are now injected into subagents (new capability vs hardcoded string)
- [ ] `Session ID:` line is still injected into every session (verified via existing `EchoSessionId` handler)
- [ ] `InjectSessionInstructions` class is fully removed
- [ ] All tests pass (`mvn -f client/pom.xml verify` exits 0)
- [ ] E2E: Start a session and confirm all behavioral rules appear in context from plugin rules source
